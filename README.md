# metafetcher
A lightweight link preview API designed for rendering link embeds in SLChat.
Supports [OpenGraph](https://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Card](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-for-websites/cards/overview/markup) metadata formats.

Originally developed as a subproject in the [SLChat-External](https://github.com/SLT-World/SLChat-External/commit/5f63b720c03b69ecb502314d0ea59554d3982a91) repository to reduce SLChat's reliance on third-party services.

Metafetcher has been moved to this repository to prevent unnecessary Cloudflare build triggers on unrelated updates within [SLChat-External](https://github.com/SLT-World/SLChat-External/).
